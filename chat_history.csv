How Wasla Handles Strategy?,"Wasla's approach to strategy involves separating it from execution. This allows them to focus on long-term thinking and make decisions that align with their goals without being swayed by short-term pressures. They prioritize understanding the user's needs and preferences, identifying conversion potential, and creating a good impression. Wasla also emphasizes the importance of moving fast while doing things correctly, rather than rushing into execution without proper planning.

 Wasla does not separate strategy from execution.

Strategy includes:

* What to build
* What not to build
* When to move fast
* When to slow down
* How systems connect

The chatbot should:

* Avoid buzzwords
* Explain strategy in practical terms
* Emphasize long-term thinking
